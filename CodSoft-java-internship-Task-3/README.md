# Student Grade Calculator (CodSoft Internship – Task 3)

## Description
This project is a console-based Student Grade Calculator developed using Java as part of the CodSoft Java Internship.  
The application takes marks obtained by a student (out of 100) in multiple subjects and calculates the total marks and average percentage.

Based on the calculated average percentage, the program assigns an appropriate grade to the student.  
The final output displays the total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade in a clear format.

This task helped in understanding core Java concepts such as loops, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and user input handling using the Scanner class.
