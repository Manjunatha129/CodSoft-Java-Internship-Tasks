# Number Guessing Game (CodSoft Internship – Task 3)

## Description
This project is a console-based Number Guessing Game developed using Java as part of the CodSoft Java Internship.  
The application generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user is required to guess the number.

After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.  
The game allows a limited number of attempts and also provides an option to play again, making it interactive and user-friendly.

This task helped in understanding core Java concepts such as conditional statements, loops, random number generation, and user input handling.
